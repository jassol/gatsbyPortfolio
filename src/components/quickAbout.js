      <h1>Hi, I'm Jasmin.</h1>
      <p>Professionally I am a full stack developer working primarily in Javascript. My background in supply chain management taught me that not all software is good software: I became an engineer to fix that. My goal is to build digital products that are speedy, reliable and intuitive.
      </p>
      <p> Unprofessionally, I love backpacking, board games, and interior design. Also, donuts. Seriously. If you want to know the best place in NYC, let's talk.</p>
